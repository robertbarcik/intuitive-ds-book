This growth is not unjustified though. Majority of the firms did undergo a process of digitalization within the past 2-3 decades. Opportunities within digitalization, such as digital offering of products, digital channels for marketing, are however reaching new maturity points. According to microeconomics and its law of diminishing marginal utility, for every penny invested early, the return will be large. While if we keep investing, after certain time the investment of same penny will yield only much smaller benefit. Due to this reason, lots of companies are these days turning from digitalization (as a sole investment) into a related field of data science. insert picture of diminishing utility This is supported by the fact that the process of digitalization inevitably collects data. Thereafter companies see that even with minimal investment into this trend, the benefits can be significant. If you would look at the past major drivers which influenced companies, you could observe something like this. insert picture of eras within market And this is where you come in, with your opportunity to grow your career, naturally following what market does.

Let me reason about that, even before I introduce you to the structure and the transformation that the book offers. I have been a lecturer and trainer for a few years and I always notice that actually content does not matter as much as the path through the content as well as the assumptions upon which the content is built. Only if both of these are fine, the book/course/training can offer you (the reader/student) a transformation - taking you from where you are, to where you want to be. This book is hence built on five cornerstones: - Data Science is a practice of using data to create a direct benefit. - Citizen Data Scientist is becoming a crucial occupation. - Anyone can become a Citizen Data Scientist. - There are 6 levels of Citizen Data Scientist and these should act as a learning curve. - Math is not required as a teaching tool in order to train a Citizen Data Scientist and can be replaced by visualisation and intuition. Did I go crazy claiming that anyone can become a Data Scientist? And what about the Math which is appraised by everyone as the crucial tool within data science?!? Maybe I have, but these cornerstones (assumptions) worked for me as well as for my students within the past years. Let me first explain why I believe that these things might work out for you. 2.2 Defining Data Science When it comes to defining Data Science, it is really crucial to define what Data Science is not, because often times people think about methods, instead of the field itself. Data Scientist is not bound to a context, such as Banking, Medicine and so forth, similar to software development. 2.3 Who is Citizen Data Scientist You most likely heard about Data Scienstits, but who are Citizen Data Scientists? I think they are the most crucial occupations in the future of the field of Data Science. You heard me right, not the original Data Scientists, but the new generation of Citizen Data Scientists. Let me show you why. Data Science as a field has been around for decades in one form or another. There has been market analysts, risk modellers, product developers, artificial intelligence developers and so on. If we however relate to the definition of Data Science above in a way that a Data Scientist can essentially come to any company and make use of its data to create benefit, we can go back to the millenia breakthrough. Universities start to offer programs with names like “Data Analysis”, “Business Intelligence” and first candidates are leaving these programs. It feels like the field is growing tremedously - growth in GPU powers, Deep Learning, Automated Machine Learning products. Especially since 2010s, job advertisments revolving around Data Science are exploding! Though is the field really growing from the perspective of market? I would say very slowly, simply because the created benefit for companies (and customers) is growing slowly. This is cause by the fact that the field is still relying on the slow and linear growth of the first generation of Data Scientists - ones having formal education, being able to guarantee the work and so on. Now two scenarios can occur when a company attempts to create benefit/profit through data science: 1. It hires actual Data Scientists, whereas costs to hire them are tremendous and what is even more expensive is to make them productive. Finding for them process which can be optimized through their methods and then properly optimizing it is lengthy and costly. Company slowly looses interest and stops believing that actual profit in a decent scale can be created this way. 2. It does not hire actual Data Scientists, as they are expensive and scarce. People who come to the company have been originally trained in other areas and are now expected to be actual Data Scientists. The company has just thrown away a lot of their potential as only their recently acquired experience are counted and not their original context. The hirees are now pushed equally hard as the actual Data Scientists and are struggling to create valuable products. Company slowly looses interest and stops believing that actual profit in decent scale can be created this way. You might now disagree with me and say I am too much of a negativist. To justify my thinking in your mind, let me ask you only one question. As employees, we are expected to create larger profit than what we cost our employer. How many data scientists you know, who can prove that they are repeatedly creating profit for their companies? Not so many right? Thereafter I beliebe that above described struggle holds. I believe that the answer to above described struggle of many companies is recognition of a Citizen Data Scientist and definition of their relationship to Data Scientists. The market is begging us to do so and we can see it by who comes to job interviews when we make an advertisment for a position of a Data Scientist. These are people who do not have formal education or direct experience. Let me tell you one story from my past. I worked in large organization with thousands of employees as a Data Scientist. All of a sudden I received an email from a colleague I never heard of before. She claimed that she is really passionate about the methods of predictive modelling and Data Science and is eager to apply these methods in her CRM department. We met and she showed me R-script in which she tried a bunch of Machine Learning algorithms and preprocessing methods. What I did in turn was that I encouraged her to continue with the passion because the field has a future and I advised her about further methods she can try. Only years later, I realized my mistakes in that meeting and that I met one of the first Citizen Data Scientists. I then learned that she left the company as she never managed to get her passion to productive work. I was one of the reasons why she churned because I gave her advice on how to become the first generation Data Scientist, not the second generation Citizen Data Scientist. Let’s look at the definition by Gartner in 2016: Citizen data science bridges the gap between mainstream self-service data discovery by business users and the advanced analytics techniques of data scientists. This colleague of mine was originally in the first part of definition, while I was in the second part of it. She was trying to become a bridge between the two, without even realising it! Unfortunately I am only smarter several years later and when the same situation happens these days, I react in a different way. Also, the company which I work for now is smarter and allows for an environment where Citizen Data Scientists are given space. She had something that I could never have - expertise in her CRM department and if I was about to give her advice now it would be: - Focus on how a predictive model will create benefit in your department. Unless you create a benefit, whatever we code is worthless. - Here is a (short) list of things you should try in your R-script (most of which you already have). You do not need to push for more complex methods and crazy good programming, what you have is already enough. If something more complex is required later on, I will do it for you. Ehm, exact opposite of what I originally did right? 2.4 Value of Citizen Data Scientist As everyone says it these days - data are everywhere, companies need to start utilizing them. We can hence take as granted that Data Science will have justification in upcoming years. Though why do companies need Citizen Data Scientists and why they should focus on them instead of the first generation of Data Scientists? Simply because the growth in created benefit will be much greater as there can be multiple of them compared to Data Scientists and they are much closer to the context. They know way better what needs to be optimized and in which way, because the context (business area) is their origin. What happens with the original (first generation) Data Scientists? We will still need them, just in slightly different role as until now. They become heavy developers, guarantors and trainers. Whenever a complex problem occurs, which needs technically challenging solution, it will be them who focus on it. The thing is, that in many organizations, there is only a handful of such problems, that is why this makes sense. Secondly, they act as guarantors of solutions developed by Citizen Data Scientists. This again makes sense, because reading through something and commenting on it takes a fraction of time as compared to developing it. Finally, they should act as trainers as there is a need to train, coach and mentor a lot of Citizen Data Scientists. 2.5 Anyone Can Become Citizen Data Scientist Why do I believe that it can be acieved by anyone? Because the data science as toolset will always be dependent on context knowledge. Thereafter whatever your background is, you can become one and be valuable for a company. give example of various occupations 2.6 The 6 levels You can have a great content, great exercises, but unless I am able to keep you motivated and you feel like you are growing with every module finished, my course/book is not good. That is why this book sets 6 levels through which you will be growing. With each new level, your power within data science will inherently grow and so will your value for employers. This gives you the ultimate opportunity to practice your skills - because you will be able to; in real world! As you will notice, each level holds its definition and a length required (from my perspective) to reach this level from a previous one. Being Aware - You know what the field is about, what it can and cannot achieve. Learning: 1 hour Observer - You are able to observe a data science project running, without being able to contribute to it. You are though able to make use of the outputs of a Data Science project as well as help with inputs for such project. Learning: 5 hours Contributor - You are able to assume a (simple) task(s) within Data Science project, and create a benefit to the project productively. Learning: 30 hours Statistician - You are able to assume any basic task within a Data Science project and hold responsibility for statistical parts. Learning: 80 hours Project Responsible - You are able to define Data Science project and execute it. Learning: 40 hours Guru - You are able to grow Data Science initiative in your organization both effectively (hiring) as well as conceptually (specializations). Learning: 40 hours Each of these levels is very different both from the content perspective, as well as from desirable approach by you. For example, on a Statistician level, you are going to be focused solely on statistical formulas and their intuition. Be prepared for sitting longer hours, stretching your analytical mind. All of a sudden, this stops and in order to become a Project Responsible, we are going to sharpen your soft skills, such as how to organize a team effectively. It will be needed to free your mind and think about people instead of code. What is the biggest struggle of anyone who would like to become a (Citizen) Data Scientist? To get real world experience and practice. Whatever people claim within their online courses and trainings, the trainer will never be able to offer you what is awaiting for you in the real world of Data Science. Even I don’t claim it about my trainings. The only truthful way is hence to go to a real project, with which there is another problem. You come to a job interview (external or internal one) and say that you have been learning and would like to become part of this Data Science project. The conversation might go as follows: Interviewer: Great to see your interest. So how can you contribute to our projects and help out? You: Well, I learned a bit of Python, I am able to put together some basic statistical model and also do some data preprocessing. Let me stop here for a second and explain to you what is happening behind this scene of this situation, which is happening probably hundreds of times every day. You are having hard time selling yourself and interviewer is having hard time evaluating your qualities. You are both stuck, due to simple reason - you have listed skills instead of capability to contribute. Now let’s do a similar conversation and we will reuse one of the levels from above as your answer: Interviewer: Great to see your interest. So how can you contribute to our projects and help out? You: I am able to act as an “Observer” to your Data Science projects. This means that I cannot directly contribute to it’s productive code pipeline, but I am able to help out with inputs and outputs. Due to my extensive background in Retail Banking, I know what features might be interesting to collect about customers and used in models and also how to apply outputs of your project in Marketing Campaigns. Do you feel the difference between the two conversations? Instead of talking about skills, you started to talk about a possible contribution which you can do. Moreover, you had a space to relate to your previous field - we all have something where we are coming from. This is what really matters for Citizen Data Scientist - show possible contribution that will be impacting the project and benefit out of it directly. 2.7 Learning Without Math Mathematics is undoubtedly the foundation of many fields, Data Science being one of them. If one masters it, incredible beauties will uncover in a lot of mathematical formulae and deep understanding of many concepts can be achieved. It has only one problem…“it’s f_____g hard to learn!!!”. I personally know only two kinds of people. First group are ones who are comfortable with math - they liked the subject since many years and have the incredible patience to learn it. Most of the times they also invested into some form of formal education within math. The second group are people who don’t like it and whenever they meet it, they search for intuitions and workarounds just to get the piece of work done. The share of people who belong to the latter group among my friends is 95% and that could be a sad fact for a field like Data Science which would like to grow, while being based heavily on Math. Or is it? In my perspective, the first generation of Data Scientists are primarily the ones who are fine with map and the second generation belongs to the non-likers. Now let me tell you, it’s perfectly fine and natural to not like math and not be comfortable with it. Who should adjust? Should it be 95% of population or teaching methods of Data Science? Let me bet on the latter… That is why this book will not teach anything through mathematics. I honestly believe that in order to train a Citizen Data Scientist, math is not only un-needed but also un-recommended, based on my argumentation above. 2.8 Level 1 Reached Congratulations! Without even realizing it, you have reached the first level which I call “Being Aware”. You are now aware of what Data Science is, and what it isn’t and what are its issues nowadays. "],
["observer.html", "Chapter 3 Observer 3.1 About this level 3.2 Data and Information 3.3 Biased Data 3.4 Data Science Project 3.5 Your Contribution", " Chapter 3 Observer 3.1 About this level We will need to develop your skills in three different areas: - Soft understanding - Programming - Statistics Once you reach this level, you will be able to act as an Observer of a Data Science project. You are not yet directly able to contribute to it (such as through coding), but you will be able to use outputs of it and help with the inputs. Thus if you are a campaigns manager in marketing department, you will know what to ask Data Scientists for and how can you use it. Also, you will have some basic tools with which you can evaluate whether the Data Scientist that your initiative is dependent on did a good job or not. As I mentioned, you will also be able to help out with inputs. Whether you know it or not - Data Science is dependent on people like you, who have the context knowledge. That is why there is the famous saying, “Garbage in Gargage out”. If you will be able to point a Data Scientist to what he should use and what he should not use, he will be grateful (unless he is stubborn). insert garbage in garbage out 3.2 Data and Information What is data and what is information? Information is what we are able to derive from data. When building a Data Science project, we base it on data and we shape its design on information. Such Data Science project will then create new information which we can use and are creating a benefit. When it comes to data, there are two areas which I observe. - Sensory Data that relate solely to machinery. - Human related data that relate to human behavior. 3.3 Biased Data Are all human-related data good to be used? Simple answer is NO. There is a lot of data from my perspective which are just wrong to be used and you as a Citizen Data Scientist should not use. I do now wish to talk now about data quality issues, but about the nature of data, which is connected with how the data came into existence. There are a lot of datasets which came to existence by asking people regarding their state or opinion. Take elections for instance. If you look at US elections, for a very long time it was seemingly impossible that Trump will win the elections. Yet, he won, even though the data from polls told us otherwise. What happened is that this (poll) dataset was created by asking people, while unfortunately it is in human nature that: - people lie with purpose - people are lazy - people want to appear different than they are Thereafter, when your Data Science project is working with people, you should not rely on data which were created through asking. I will be honest, from my perspective all survey data are just wrong and in nowadays world, I would simply skip this practice. Let’s assume you work in a bank and your task is to develop a Data Science model which will automatically be granting loans. As you are working within loans department, you very well know that the primary factor for whether your bank will grant a loan is the income of a customer. You also know that there is a field in your database that says “income” to each one of your customers. Problem solved right? You just collect a few more fields and create a model as you were asked. Well, I recommend something different. If you will ask around you will find out that this “income” field was created through self-reporting of your customers. When they are setting up their account, the advisor in a branch will ask them what is their income and they report figure X. Trust me when I say, that due to one of the reasons listed above, the customer will report a wrong number. Ok then, you tell yourself that you are smarter than that and decide to observe customer’s incoming salary transactions which you have tagged in your system. You have overcome the problem of self-reported information, right? You deploy your model into production and run your automatic loaning system. What will happen is that in some time frauds will arise and there will be a lot of customers who took huge loans and do not pay them back. How could this happen? Well, people learned how to cheat your model for their own benefit. Fraudsters are now once a month sending each other transactions which are tagged by your system as salaries and thereafter your “income” field for this customer is huge. They are then automatically granted significant loans. So, how can we solve this? The key is to obtain information which is desired through data which were created by human, while he was doing something completely natural and at best unrelated. You need to think about an action, or a process of a customer though which he/she unknowingly displays his/her truthful income. What about groceries? We all do grocery shopping, thereafter this might be a reliable source of information. What if you look at how much this customer is spending for groceries monthly and relate it to his/hers assumed income. If you have reported 1500 Euro income, how comes that you only spend 100 Euro for groceries? This is of course not a perfect solution, but what I am trying to translate is the thinking about how to solve the problem with bias about human-related data. 3.4 Data Science Project How does Data Science project create benefit? Let’s start from the very end, what should a project generate. It should be new information, in various form, that creates benefit for a person or company that financed this project. Let me emphasize the point of that the project creates new information, not new data. This is because data by themselves, have no benefit, and thereafter there would be no point in running a project that creates data and not information. This information can be in various forms, so let’s take a look at some examples: When I was at university I was tasked with creation of project, which would take recordings of people walking and it should create an information of whether people on the recordings are suffering from Parkinson’s disease or not. Having this information created various benefits, for instance (if working properly), expensive time of doctor is saved. Ultimately, people could self-administer this test at home without the need of visiting the doctor. The information created was the statement “Has Parkinson disease” or “Does not have Parkinson disease” to every recording. Once I ran a project which was supposed to determine a location of newly opened retail stores in a country. The input for my project was the network of roads and cities in the country with their respective counts of inhabitants. The information which my project was creating was a potential position of retail stores that would be optimized for a distribution of roads and where people live. This information created a clear benefit - competitive advantage for particular retailer. Numerous times in the past I was asked to determine customer’s probability to purchase an item. My project always took as an input various customer data such as their demographics while it predicted a probability to purchase particular item (information). This information has a benefit that a business representative can then decide whether he/she will invest into marketing for particular customer. I could go on, but I guess you already have the picture of what is the single requirement of any Data Science project - creating an information from which we benefit. The beneficial information can now really vary in forms. It can be anything as you already saw, but I would like to broaden your horizon even more. The output of a Data cience project can be a single diagram, or even a sentence (thereafter it does not have to be predictive modelling or optimization only). How does Data Science project look like? Essentially, all data science is about are hypothesis. This is how hypothesis is defined by Oxford dictionary: a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation. You would be surprised how many Data Scientists are forgetting some parts of this definition so I would like to focus on it. At the beginning of a project you suppose something can be done - “We are able to find ideal locations for our retail stores.”. Then you examine whether you already do not have enough evidence which would answer your supposition - “There is no other retailer similar to us in a given country and as we are new to the country we also have no knowledge.” 3.5 Your Contribution How can I contribute to Data Science project? I have to make a small assumption here about who you are. You are someone who works in domain - for example banking, paper industry, insurance, car sales, anything. You either have formal education in this domain, or working experience. This means that you have something that no Data Scientist has - specific knowledge of the domain. Thereafter, as we already mentioned, you can contribute to the Data Science project in two ways already on this level: contribute through inputs and through outputs. As you already know, the basis of every Data Science project are data. As you have domain knowledge, you might now about data that Data Scientist is not aware of. I will demonstrate this from one project of mine from the past. My project was using log data from a mobile application, whereas users had to go through several screens in order to complete purchase process. I collected all the log data and what it was showing was that a certain group of users was dropping of from the sales process at various point. I was struggling with it and I was unable to explain why this group of users (which had no clear characteristics) was dropping off at various times during the day. I was then approached by a call center representative, which for several years sells the same product over the phone. He did not even have to look at the data and gave me the answer! These were parents of young children! As the sales process takes an hour to get through all the screens, there is a solid probability that if you are a parent of a baby, the baby will start crying and you will of course leave your computer. The data would never reveal me this pattern, the domain knowledge did instantly. You can be the gentleman from call centre, which moves the project a light year ahead! Secondly, every data science project should produce an information that will be used to create benefit. This component of the Data Science project is often times underappreciated and you can be the one who fixes it. I will now go back to my projects where I was supposed to predict the probability that customer purchases a product. I was given this task by our CRM department to optimize email campaigns - so that these are sent only to customers who have decent probability to buy the item. Everything worked well, the Data Science project ran through, the information was created. BUT, the created benefit was close to nothing. As it later turned out, customers are generally overfed with emails and digital channels. I then met with a representative from our branch segment and he said that this information could be of great use for our sellers. The sellers have only very limited time when the customer approaches them and thereafter having the information they will be able to sell more. The data, nor my knowledge of Data Scientist would never reveal this use of the information which I created, the domain knowledge did. You can be this representative, who will multiply the created benefit our of Data Science project. How is data represented? If you plan on skipping this chapter, because it seems boring, please don’t. It would come to haunt you in your glorious future of Citizen Data Scientist. Data Science is done using computers, thereafter I think it is crucial to understand how your computer sees data. We often times think that computers are smart, while in fact they are quite basic - they understand only two values - 1’s and 0’s. In fact some of the earliest computers insert picture of some early computer Now what we often times make mistake with is that we overestimate powers of computers and we think that they understand anything - texts, colours, pictures. Well, they don’t. THey only really well understand numbers. Thereafter a lot of tasks of Data Scientists revolves around representing data well for the computer. I was on a conference where a Scandinavian bank was representing their project of revealing fraud transaction by the means of Data Science. Transaction usually looks as something like following: insert example of a transaction However what a presenter showed was something like following: insert Danske representation of a transaction One of the keys of their project is how the transactions were represented to the computer (and algorithm). We will ge tmore into this later. How does my PC handle data? As soon as you start a Data Science project, you will be facing hardware limitations. Simple reason for this is that hardware costs. Sure, you can purchase a hardware and have no flexible costs, but this hardware will be getting outdated. Thereafter, every Data Science project will be optimizing for as little hardware requirements as needed to fulfill particular task. These requirements will be coming from four crucial componenets that a computer has and I think it is hence crucial for you to learn about them now. What is a csv? Now that we know what data is, we also know what we aim to do with it and how will we manage with our computer, it is time to get our hands on some data. The simplest representation of a dataset is through so called “csv” or “comma-separated-values”. What is a “flat table”? What is a relational database? Refer maybe to Oracle? What are inputs for data science? How does my PC view features? Numerical and categorical features. What tools and languages will I meet? What is an IDE, engine and package/library? Even though you are right now at the level of Observer, you might already come in touch with programmes or libraries which make Data Science projects. Thereafter, it is important to understand a terminology here. The most obvious are so called IDEs - Integrated Development Environments. These are pretty and easy to work in. Currently, some of the most popular ones among Data Scientists are R-Studio and Jupyter Notebooks. This will be a program which tuns on a computer (either a physical one or somewhere on the server), that allows you to utilize some computing engine. There are two very popular engines, which are actually competing with each other - R and Python. Imagine these as a set of functions which are very robust and people like to use them because they are well developed and once a Data Scientist works with them, he can be sure that his work will run. Finally there are libraries. The engines as weel as IDEs are many times licensed under open-source. This makes a lot of sense, because people have a motivation to contribute to these. How will they contribute though? It would be very tricky to integrate work of thousands of people though single software - may it be R or Python. For that, we have libraries. These are way smaller sets of functions, which usually serve a specific purpose. For example, even though R serves Data Scientists, you might decide to write specific library which will be for Data Scientists which are trying to predict zombie apocalypse. You will include a set of specific functions in your library and you may decide to publish it so that other people can use it. What is R? What is Python? What is Knime? Usually when people talk about Data Scientists, they mention two languages (or frameworks) - R and Python. I however believe that in the future a different approach will dominate if we would like to grow the numbers and powers of Citizen Data Scientists. These are frameworks which does not necessarily require coding, but can do very similar things (at a tradeoff of being slightly less flexible). One such framework is Knime. What is machine learning? Machine Learning is crucial part of Data Science. Often times when I see courses or training materials, this area is postponed until the student learns a lot of basics, such as data preprocessing. Only then, it is believed, you should be exposed to Machine Learning. I believe the opposite - you should meet it already now (as an Observer), due to two reasons. Firstly, as already mentioned, Machine Learning is something like a hearth of Data Science. Secondly, it will keep your motivation higher - you need to know some cool things that you will be able to do once you finish this book. To explain you properly what Machine Learning is, I need to go into history of computing. Why did computers arise? They arose to simplify or automate tasks done by humans. One such task was to count consensus data (the survey done every 10 years which observes a population of a certain country). The problem in 1920s was that it took over 10 years to count and process the data from a consensus, thereafter making it quite worthless. insert IBM story This was great for a couple of decades. Having computers with certain rules which were doing what otherwise humans could do, was really helping humanity. Rules have problems though - they have hard and strict boundaries. If you want to design a great rule based system, you need to be really careful so that you encode all the patterns which are in the data. Firstly, it is very hard to encode all the patters into our model. Secondly, our population and data change over time. Due to that, even if you manage to encode all of the rules, very quickly will these become outdated simply due to changing nature of our world. Do I need machine learning? How much does machine learning cost? These are questions that even experienced Data Scientists often times forget to ask and they end up with what I call “overkill”. If you are considering application of machine learning, the first thing you should ask yourself is whether simpler methods cannot answer your hypothesis. I will recall one Kaggle competition to give you and example (we will get to those later). The competition was regarding game for kids. This game includes various activities such as videos, games and assesments (test). The task for a Machine Learning was to predict how many attempts will it take the kid to pass a certain assessment. There were many people who instantly jumped to Machine Learning and spent hours trying to apply Machine Learning to the problem, while thinking that their solution is pretty decent. All of a sudden a solution came which contained only 10 lines of code. All that the author of this submission did was that he looked at the absolute average of attempts that kids needed to solve a particular assignment. He then made only these predictions and beaten everyone’s Machine Learning solution. He set a new baseline of what people need to beat in order to justify the use of Machine Lerning. Keep this in mind and in the future always consider such a baseline. What is supervised learning? What is correlation? What is regression? How do I know if regression model is good? What is classification? How do I evaluate if classification model is good? Are data scientists evil? Is there a reason why to be scared of these stalkers? Propensity models Can two models and their respective probabilities be really compared? Customer and user You need to distinguish between the two The falacy of absolute numbers For many years what matters a lot is a conversion rate or a success rate. I recommend though to be careful with it. Should I focus on how my code looks? I have a saying: “People have feelings. They feel when you code like sh_t.” "],
