## Data Preprocessing

*What are feature types?*
Numbr of unique values, compared to feature type.

Think about which feature contains more information - numeric does. Ordered categorical does not contain distances.

Percentiles.

*What is data aggregation?*

*What are missing values?*

*What are extreme values?*
The abnormal can be just a matter of perspective.


*What is data validation?*

*How do I visualise numeric features?*

*How do I visualise categorical features?*

*How do I combine visualisation of two features?*


## Statistics
*What is normal distribution?*

*What are independent features and dependent feature?*

*What do I do with improperly distributet regression dependent feature?*

*What do I do with imbalanced classification dependent feature?*

*What is a hypothesis?*

*What is a cost function?*

*What is simplest regression model?*

*What is simplest classification model?*
